# Julia Course

This repository contains the code for the [Julia Course](https://gianluca-mastrantonio.github.io/julia_course/) held at the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it).

The course is divided into several sections that you can find in the "julia" directory in this repository. 

The sections are:

* [basic operations](basic_operations): basic operations in Julia
* [functions](functions): functions in Julia
* [packages](packages): packages in Julia
* [miscellany](miscellany): miscellaneous topics

Each section contains a subdirectory with the code for the corresponding section.

The code is intended to be used as a starting point for the course.

The course is based on the [Julia Manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/) and the [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/).
